# Loan Tracker - Ionic Application

This project is an Ionic application for tracking loans.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** Version 20 or 20+ is required.  You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). It's recommended to use a Node version manager like nvm (node version manager) or fnm (fast node manager) to easily switch between Node versions.
* **npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn:**  npm is typically bundled with Node.js.
* **Ionic CLI (Command Line Interface):** Install globally using npm: `npm install -g @ionic/cli` or using yarn: `yarn global add @ionic/cli`
* **Git:**  For version control (recommended). You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
* **A Code Editor:**  VS Code is highly recommended, but you can use any editor you prefer.  VS Code has excellent extensions for Ionic and TypeScript development.
* **Android Studio and/or Xcode:** Required for building native mobile applications for Android and iOS respectively.  These are large installations.  Install them only when you need to build for specific platforms.  You can start with browser development and then add native platform support later.
